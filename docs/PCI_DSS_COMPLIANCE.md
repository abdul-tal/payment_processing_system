## Cardholder Data Environment (CDE)

### Data Classification

**Cardholder Data (CHD):**
- Primary Account Number (PAN) - Encrypted at rest
- Cardholder Name - Stored in plain text (not sensitive under PCI DSS)
- Expiration Date - Stored in plain text
- Service Code - Not stored

**Sensitive Authentication Data (SAD):**
- CVV/CVC - Encrypted, not stored after authorization
- PIN - Not handled by this system
- Magnetic stripe data - Not handled by this system

### Data Flow

1. **Data Input:** All cardholder data sanitized and validated
2. **Processing:** Sensitive data encrypted before any storage
3. **Storage:** Only encrypted CHD stored, no SAD retention
4. **Transmission:** HTTPS/TLS for all communications
5. **Logging:** All access logged, sensitive data masked

## Security Controls Implementation

### Encryption Controls

```typescript
// Example of secure card number handling
const cardNumber = '4111111111111111';

// 1. Validate and sanitize input
const sanitized = inputSanitizer.sanitizeCreditCardNumber(cardNumber);

// 2. Encrypt for storage
const encrypted = encryptionService.encryptCardNumber(sanitized.sanitizedValue);

// 3. Mask for logging
const masked = encryptionService.maskCardNumber(cardNumber);
logger.info('Card processed', { cardNumber: masked });
```

### Access Control

```typescript
// API endpoint with proper access control
app.post('/api/v1/payments', 
  authenticateApiKey('write'),  // Require write permission
  requirePermission('payment'), // Require payment permission
  asyncHandler(paymentController.createPayment)
);
```

### Audit Logging

```typescript
// Comprehensive audit logging
await securityAuditService.logPaymentEvent(
  'PAYMENT_ATTEMPT',
  success,
  {
    transaction_id: 'txn-123',
    amount: 100.00,
    payment_method: 'card',
    // No sensitive data in logs
  },
  req
);
```

## Compliance Validation

### Automated Testing

Run the security test suite to validate compliance:

```bash
# Unit tests
npm run test:unit -- tests/unit/security.test.ts

# Integration tests  
npm run test:integration -- tests/integration/security.integration.test.ts
```

### Manual Validation Checklist

- [ ] No unencrypted cardholder data in database
- [ ] No sensitive data in application logs
- [ ] All API endpoints require authentication
- [ ] Input validation on all user inputs
- [ ] Proper error handling without data exposure
- [ ] Audit logs capture all data access
- [ ] Encryption keys properly managed
- [ ] Rate limiting prevents abuse
- [ ] Webhook signatures validated
- [ ] Failed authentication attempts logged

## Security Incident Response

### Detection

The system automatically detects and logs:
- Multiple failed authentication attempts
- Suspicious payment patterns
- Invalid webhook signatures
- Input validation failures
- System errors and exceptions

### Response

1. **Immediate:** Security events logged with correlation IDs
2. **Analysis:** Review audit logs for patterns
3. **Containment:** API key revocation if compromised
4. **Recovery:** System monitoring and additional logging
5. **Lessons Learned:** Update security controls as needed

### Monitoring Queries

```typescript
// Get security events for analysis
const events = await securityAuditService.getSecurityEvents({
  severity: 'HIGH',
  start_date: new Date(Date.now() - 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000),
  limit: 100
});

// Generate security report
const report = await securityAuditService.generateSecurityReport(
  startDate, 
  endDate
);
```

## Key Management

### Encryption Key Management

- **Master Key:** Stored in environment variable `ENCRYPTION_MASTER_KEY`
- **Key Rotation:** Supported through key versioning (future enhancement)
- **Key Storage:** Never logged or exposed in error messages
- **Key Strength:** Minimum 32 characters, cryptographically random

### API Key Management

- **Generation:** Cryptographically secure random generation
- **Storage:** Hashed using SHA-256
- **Rotation:** Manual revocation and regeneration supported
- **Permissions:** Granular role-based permissions

## Compliance Maintenance

1. **Monthly:** Review security audit logs
2. **Quarterly:** Run full security test suite
3. **Annually:** Review and update security policies
4. **As Needed:** Respond to security incidents

### Documentation Updates
