# Task 007: Webhook Processing System

## Overview
Implement asynchronous webhook handling system for Authorize.Net payment notifications with queue-based processing.

## Objectives
- Implement POST /api/v1/webhooks/authorize-net endpoint
- Set up webhook signature verification
- Implement event queue system (Redis-based)
- Create webhook event processors
- Implement dead letter queue for failed events
- Add duplicate event detection

## Deliverables
- Webhook controller for receiving events
- Signature verification middleware
- Redis queue configuration
- Event processor workers
- Dead letter queue handling
- Webhook event retry logic
- Event deduplication system

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Webhook endpoint receives and validates signatures
- [ ] Events are queued for asynchronous processing
- [ ] Event processors handle different event types
- [ ] Failed events are moved to dead letter queue
- [ ] Duplicate events are detected and ignored
- [ ] Processing status is tracked and logged

## Dependencies
- Task 003 (Express Server Setup)
- Task 004 (Authorize.Net Integration)

## Estimated Time
6-7 hours
