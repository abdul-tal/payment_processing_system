# Task 008: Distributed Tracing and Correlation IDs

## Overview
Implement comprehensive distributed tracing system with correlation IDs for end-to-end request tracking.

## Objectives
- Implement correlation ID generation and propagation
- Set up distributed tracing infrastructure
- Add tracing to all service layers
- Implement request/response logging with correlation IDs
- Create trace aggregation and visualization
- Add performance monitoring and bottleneck detection

## Deliverables
- Correlation ID middleware
- Tracing service integration
- Request/response logging with trace context
- Performance metrics collection
- Trace visualization setup
- Bottleneck detection alerts

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Correlation IDs are generated for all requests
- [ ] Traces span across all service layers
- [ ] Request flows are traceable end-to-end
- [ ] Performance bottlenecks are identifiable
- [ ] Trace data is properly aggregated
- [ ] Monitoring dashboards show trace metrics

## Dependencies
- Task 003 (Express Server Setup)
- Task 005 (Payment Endpoints)

## Estimated Time
4-5 hours
